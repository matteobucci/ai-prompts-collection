# Prompt Engineering Guide

## Effective Prompt Construction

### Structure Template
```
**Role Definition**: You are a [SPECIFIC_EXPERT_ROLE] with expertise in [DOMAIN]

**Context Setting**: 
- Technical environment: [TECH_STACK]
- Business domain: [BUSINESS_CONTEXT]
- Constraints: [LIMITATIONS_AND_REQUIREMENTS]

**Task Description**: [CLEAR_OBJECTIVE_WITH_SPECIFIC_DELIVERABLES]

**Input Specification**: 
[DETAILED_INPUT_FORMAT_AND_REQUIREMENTS]

**Output Requirements**:
1. [SPECIFIC_DELIVERABLE_1]
2. [SPECIFIC_DELIVERABLE_2]
3. [SPECIFIC_DELIVERABLE_3]

**Quality Criteria**: [SUCCESS_METRICS_AND_EVALUATION_STANDARDS]

**Additional Guidelines**: [SPECIFIC_RULES_OR_CONSTRAINTS]
```

## Prompt Optimization Techniques

### 1. Role-Based Prompting
Define the AI's expertise level and perspective:
- "As a senior software architect..."
- "Acting as a security specialist..."
- "From the perspective of a code reviewer..."

### 2. Context Layering
Provide information in order of importance:
- **Critical context**: Must-have information for task completion
- **Supporting context**: Helpful background information
- **Optional context**: Nice-to-have details for refinement

### 3. Output Format Specification
Be explicit about desired response structure:
- Bullet points vs paragraphs
- Code examples with explanations
- Step-by-step procedures
- Comparison tables or matrices

### 4. Constraint Definition
Clearly state limitations and boundaries:
- Technology stack restrictions
- Performance requirements
- Security considerations
- Team skill level considerations

## Common Prompt Patterns

### Analysis Prompts
```
Analyze [SUBJECT] considering:
1. [DIMENSION_1] - [SPECIFIC_CRITERIA]
2. [DIMENSION_2] - [SPECIFIC_CRITERIA]
3. [DIMENSION_3] - [SPECIFIC_CRITERIA]

Provide:
- Summary of findings
- Prioritized recommendations
- Implementation considerations
```

### Implementation Prompts
```
Implement [FUNCTIONALITY] that:
- Solves [SPECIFIC_PROBLEM]
- Follows [STANDARDS_OR_PATTERNS]
- Integrates with [EXISTING_SYSTEMS]

Include:
- Complete working code
- Error handling
- Documentation
- Testing approach
```

### Review and Optimization Prompts
```
Review [CODE_OR_DESIGN] for:
- [QUALITY_DIMENSION_1]
- [QUALITY_DIMENSION_2]
- [QUALITY_DIMENSION_3]

Provide:
- Issues found with severity levels
- Specific improvement suggestions
- Refactored examples for major issues
- Best practice recommendations
```

## Measuring Prompt Effectiveness

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Correctness of generated solutions
- **Completeness**: Coverage of all requirements
- **Efficiency**: Time saved vs manual approach
- **Consistency**: Reliable results across similar inputs

### Qualitative Assessment
- **Clarity**: How well the output addresses the question
- **Usefulness**: Practical applicability of suggestions
- **Innovation**: Creative solutions and approaches
- **Learning value**: Educational benefit for the team

## Prompt Iteration Strategy

### Version Control for Prompts
- Track prompt changes over time
- Document effectiveness improvements
- Share successful patterns with team
- Maintain library of proven templates

### Feedback Integration
- Collect usage feedback from team members
- Identify common failure patterns
- Refine based on real-world usage
- Create specialized variants for specific use cases
