# Cloud Deployment & Infrastructure

Modern cloud deployment strategies with Infrastructure as Code, container orchestration, and automated CI/CD pipelines.

## üéØ Cloud Platforms

### Major Cloud Providers
- **AWS**: Comprehensive cloud services with extensive ecosystem
- **Google Cloud Platform**: Strong in AI/ML and container services  
- **Microsoft Azure**: Enterprise-focused with hybrid capabilities
- **Vercel/Netlify**: Specialized in frontend and serverless deployments

### Deployment Strategies
- **Serverless**: Function-as-a-Service and managed services
- **Container**: Docker and Kubernetes orchestration
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi
- **Platform as a Service**: Heroku, Railway, Render

## üõ†Ô∏è Infrastructure Tools

### Infrastructure as Code
- **Terraform**: Multi-cloud infrastructure provisioning
- **AWS CDK**: Cloud Development Kit for AWS
- **Pulumi**: Modern IaC with familiar programming languages
- **CloudFormation**: AWS native infrastructure templates

### Container Orchestration
- **Kubernetes**: Production-grade container orchestration
- **Docker Swarm**: Simpler container clustering
- **AWS ECS/Fargate**: Managed container services
- **Google Cloud Run**: Serverless containers

### CI/CD Platforms
- **GitHub Actions**: Integrated with GitHub repositories
- **GitLab CI**: Built-in DevOps platform
- **AWS CodePipeline**: Native AWS CI/CD
- **Azure DevOps**: Microsoft's complete DevOps solution

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Prometheus + Grafana**: Open-source monitoring stack
- **DataDog**: Comprehensive monitoring platform
- **New Relic**: Application performance monitoring
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Native AWS monitoring

## üöÄ Deployment Patterns

### Blue-Green Deployment
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Instant rollback capabilities
- Resource duplication during transition
- Ideal for critical production systems

### Canary Deployment
- Gradual traffic shifting
- Risk mitigation through phased rollout
- Real-world testing with limited exposure
- Automated rollback based on metrics

### Rolling Deployment
- Sequential instance updates
- Maintains service availability
- Resource-efficient approach
- Standard for stateless applications

### Feature Flags
- Runtime configuration changes
- A/B testing capabilities
- Risk-free feature rollouts
- Decoupled deployment from release

## üìã Setup Categories

### Basic Cloud Setup
- Account creation and billing setup
- IAM and security configuration
- Network and VPC setup
- Basic monitoring and alerting

### Container Deployment
- Docker image creation and optimization
- Container registry setup
- Kubernetes cluster configuration
- Service mesh implementation

### Serverless Architecture
- Function deployment and configuration
- API Gateway setup
- Database and storage integration
- Event-driven architecture

### Full Infrastructure
- Multi-environment setup (dev/staging/prod)
- Auto-scaling configuration
- Backup and disaster recovery
- Security and compliance setup
